# Stats merger for minecraft beta 1.7.3

## What is this?

This small script answers this specific problem: you copied a minecraft world but forgot to copy the stats too, and now you want to combine the stats fils from both minecraft installations.

This adds every field of both stat files and calculates the new checksum.

This program is made for minecraft b1.7.3.

## Disclaimer

I am in no way responsible if you lose any file, make a backup of your stats file, because if minecraft doesn't like the new file it will erase the stats.

This is made for beta 1.7.3 and I don't think it will work on other versions.

## How to use

Get the stats files from both installations. They can be found under .minecraft/stats and end with .dat. Start the script, select file a, select file b, and then save the new file. Make a backup before permanently replacing a file.

If in minecraft all your stats are reset, then this didn't work (probably because of the checksum, see "CHECKSUM MISMATCH" message in minecraft's logs).
